# Univariate-Linear-Regression

In this project, I have performed machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms myself, so I have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

Projects Include: <br />
Loading the Data and Libraries <br />
Visualize the Data <br />
Compute the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃) <br />
Gradient Descent <br />
Visualize the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃) <br />
Plot the Convergence <br />
Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit <br />
Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
