# Univariate-Linear-Regression

In this project, I have performed machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms yourself, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

Projects Include:
Loading the Data and Libraries
Visualize the Data
Compute the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃)
Gradient Descent
Visualize the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃)
Plot the Convergence
Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit
Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
